# TicTacToe
This repository contains a TicTacToe game made using React.

The project is focused only on getting sterted with React, so the css and html is kept at minimum. It is a classic tic, tac , toe game where the X stars and O follows. 
It has a History Mode, the playes can go back in time to a specific move. When a player wins, the game automaticlly stops, but the History Mode remains viable.
